# Trip Planner - Travel app

Trip Planner is a travel planning tool designed to make it easier to organize and share trip ideas. Initially, this project started when I wanted to share travel suggestions with my husband through Google Docs, but it lacked interactivity and appeal.

**The goal of the project is to build a dynamic and engaging platform where users can easily plan and manage their trips and vacations.**

The app is currently in the development phase. A basic structure has been created in Figma, and the frontend is being built with React, as I continue to improve my skills in React development through an ongoing Udemy course. The design and functionality will evolve as the project progresses.

## Main features:

Create trips with multiple destinations
Add custom tags to trips for easy filtering
Select locations on a map, and add descriptions and links for inspiration
Browse trips in list format or on a map, with destinations represented by clickable dots showing brief details
Invite friends to collaborate on vacation plans, vote on accommodations, assign tasks, and manage personal checklists
View a user profile that tracks both planned and past vacations, with editing and sharing options for trips
