# Trip Planner - Travel app

Trip Planner make organising and sharing your trip ideas easier.

Initially, this project started when I wanted to share travel suggestions with my husband through Google Docs, but it lacked interactivity and appeal.

**The goal of the project is to build a dynamic and engaging platform where users can easily plan and manage their trips and vacations.**

The app is currently in the development phase. The design and functionality will evolve as the project progresses.

## Main features:

- Create trips with multiple destinations
- Add custom tags to trips for easy filtering
- Select locations on a map, and add descriptions and links for inspiration
- Browse trips in list format or on a map, with destinations represented by clickable dots showing brief details
- Invite friends to collaborate on vacation plans, vote on accommodations, assign tasks, and manage personal checklists
- View a user profile that tracks both planned and past vacations, with editing and sharing options for trips
